Clyde
======
Clyde is a lamp with a lot of personality that you can adapt, play with, and truly call your own. Clyde is open source and Arduino-compatible.  You can change how Clyde reacts to his environment by inserting personality modules on his main controller board. You can also change how Clyde behaves by reprogramming his firmware using the standard Arduino IDE.
